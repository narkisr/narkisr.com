Iv been a software for more than 12 years working on various projects ranging from Devops to Bigdata, Automation and Cloud infrastructure using a wide range of programming languages and tools.

I specialize in the opensource eco-system and the solutions it provides thus enabling me to choose the best tool for the job.

Some of my favorite tools include Clojure, ZFS, Git and Gradle.
