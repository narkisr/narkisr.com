Who Am I?

A software for more than 12 years working on various projects ranging from Devops to Bigdata, Automation and Cloud infrastructure using a wide range of programming languages and tools.

specializing in the opensource eco system and the solutions it provides enabling me to choose the best tool for the job.

Deeply in love with Clojure and functional programming, ZFS and any tech that delivers.
